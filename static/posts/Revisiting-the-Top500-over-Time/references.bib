  abstract = {This paper describes the LINPACK Benchmark [41] and some of its variations commonly used to assess performance of computer systems. Aside from the LINPACK benchmark suite, the TOP500 [43], and the HPL [48] code are presented. The latter is frequently used to obtained results for TOP500 submissions. Information is also given on how to interpret results of the benchmark and how the results fit into performance evaluation process.},
