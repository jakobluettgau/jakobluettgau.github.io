The design borrows from a hand-fan my girlfriend likes very much. We start from cutting slices on the tablesaw, work out down to 0.8mm with the hand plane and cut the rough shape on the laser. Everything gets sanded to final shape before a laser-cut textile screen is added to hold the shape.","image":"./thumb.png","caption":"","published":true,"id":"Crafting-a-Hand-Fan","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Crafting-a-Hand-Fan","date":"2023-06-17T12:41:00.000Z"},{"title":"On the Development of Data Volumes in Long-Term Archives over the last 13 Years","authors":["Jakob Luettgau"],"datetime":"2023-05-30T12:41:00.000Z","text":"New data is being produced at unprecedented scales. Not all if this data might be worthy to be preserved, but the combination of more, cheaper, faster, higher-resolution sensors, and more capable computational devices lead to ever increasing data generation capabilities. This is true for individuals, business and of course also scientific use cases. Especially, observational data from environmental sensors, satellites, telescopse and other large scale science instruments are producers of large amounts of data which we would like to preserve in long-term archives. Today most long-term are using automated tape libraies as they offer high-capacities at low operating costs. In this article we introduce a data set destilled from 13 years of published data volumes and file counts for various long-term archives mostly used in scientific contexts.","image":"./thumb.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"13-Years-of-Long-Term-Archives","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/13-Years-of-Long-Term-Archives","date":"2023-05-30T12:41:00.000Z"},{"title":"Demonstrating the Effect of Network Topology on Point-to-Point Latency in High-Performance Computing","authors":["Jakob Luettgau"],"datetime":"2023-03-19T12:41:00.000Z","text":"High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications are often tightly coupled and sensitive to latency between different processing elements but also to I/O contention due communication that flow through the same physical links. In most of todays supercomputers, the networks are shared resource which can lead to unpredictable runtime performance due to contention with other applications. The observed network performance in many cases is intimitely related to the underlying network topology. In many HPC systems, this topology is a fat tree which can lead to very characteristic latency patterns especially for large applications that span many nodes.","image":"./point-to-point.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Demonstrating-the-Effect-of-Network-Topologies-in-HPC","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Demonstrating-the-Effect-of-Network-Topologies-in-HPC","date":"2023-03-19T12:41:00.000Z"}]}
