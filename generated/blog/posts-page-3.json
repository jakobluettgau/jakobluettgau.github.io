The project involved various forms of metal processing, from bending, to welding and treatment as well as woodworking for the seating elements and back support. The goal was to build a height-adjustable chair that would come out under a $100 per chair.

Here we take a particular look at I/O performance data tied to specirfic scientific workflows, but many of the considerations should be true for other distributed systems. We look how, while the model is at the heart of learned approaches, a lot of the mechanics and important choices lie in the data generating distribution, the loss and regularization methods used to update the model across multiple iterations of training epochs.","image":"./svg/ml.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Machine-Learning-Fundamentals-for-Systems-Optimization","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Machine-Learning-Fundamentals-for-Systems-Optimization","date":"2022-03-30T17:40:31.000Z"},{"title":"Map of Machine Learning Approaches","authors":["Jakob Luettgau"],"datetime":"2021-09-21T17:37:58Z","text":"The landscape of machine learning approahes is vast and only increases to grow as computational power is available. Without any aspiration to be complete, this post maps out a number of very established machine learning methods and relates them to each other. The resulting graph when using a spring-layout yields an interesting perspective that also intuitively appears appropriate.","image":"./svg/ml_nn-approaches-no-text.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Map-of-Machine-Learning-Approaches","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Map-of-Machine-Learning-Approaches","date":"2021-09-21T17:37:58.000Z"}]}
