We claim that data acquisition without uncertainty quantification is not sustainable and machine learning and computational modelling cannot unfold their potential when analysing complex natural systems like the Earth. Current approaches such as stochastic perturbation of parameters or initial conditions cannot quantify uncertainty or bias arising from the choice of model, limiting scientific progress. We need incentives stimulating the honest treatment of uncertainty starting during data acquisition, continuing through analysis methodology and prediction results. Computational modellers and machine learning experts have a critical role, since they enjoy high esteem from stakeholders and their methodologies and their results critically depend on data uncertainty. If both want to advance their uncertainty assessment of models and predictions of complex systems like the Earth, they have a common problem to solve. Together, computational modellers and machine learners could develop new strategies for bias identification and uncertainty quantification offering a more all-embracing uncertainty quantification than any known methodology. But since it starts for computational modellers and machine learners with data and their uncertainty, the fundamental first step in such a development would be leveraging shareholder esteem to insistently advocate for reduction of ignorance when it comes to uncertainty quantification of data.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {computational modelling,data uncertainty,machine learning,model uncertainty,uncertainty quantification}\n}\n\n@article{10.1109/MCSE.2024.3489732,\n  title = {Converged {{Computing}}: {{A Best}} of {{Both Worlds}} of {{High-Performance Computing}} and {{Cloud}}},\n  author = {Sochat, Vanessa V. and Milroy, Daniel and Misale, Claudia and L{\\"u}ttgau, Jakob and Bollig, Evan F. and Magro, William},\n  year = {2024},\n  journal = {Computing in Science \\& Engineering},\n  volume = {26},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {4--7},\n  doi = {10.1109/MCSE.2024.3489732},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2024.3489732},\n  keywords = {/unread}\n}\n\n@article{10.1145/3544497.3544508,\n  title = {Data-{{Aware Compression}} for {{HPC}} Using {{Machine Learning}}},\n  author = {Plehn, Julius and Fuchs, Anna and Kuhn, Michael and L{\\"u}ttgau, Jakob and Ludwig, Thomas},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = jun,\n  journal = {ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review},\n  volume = {56},\n  number = {; Issue 1},\n  pages = {62--69},\n  issn = {0163-5980},\n  doi = {10.1145/3544497.3544508},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3544497.3544508},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {While compression can provide significant storage and cost savings, its use within HPC applications is often only of secondary concern.

Any of these areas can become a performance bottleneck. We present a framework for analyzing internal material structures (e.g., cracks) to mitigate these bottlenecks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for a workflow performing synchrotron X-ray computed tomography reconstruction and segmentation of a silica-based structure. Our framework provides a cloud-based, cutting-edge solution to challenges such as growing intermediate and output data and heavy resource demands during image reconstruction and segmentation. Specifically, our framework efficiently manages data storage, scaling up compute resources on the cloud. The multi-layer software structure of our framework includes three layers. A top layer uses Jupyter notebooks and serves as the user interface. A middle layer uses Ansible for resource deployment and managing the execution environment. A low layer is dedicated to resource management and provides resource management and job scheduling on heterogeneous nodes (i.e., GPU and CPU). At the core of this layer, Kubernetes supports resource management, and Dask enables large-scale job scheduling for heterogeneous resources. The broader impact of our work is four-fold: through our framework, we hide the complexity of the cloud\'s software stack to the user who otherwise is required to have expertise in cloud technologies; we manage job scheduling efficiently and in a scalable manner; we enable resource elasticity and workflow orchestration at a large scale; and we facilitate moving the study of nonporous structures, which has wide applications in engineering and scientific fields, to the cloud. While we demonstrate the capability of our framework for a specific materials science application, it can be adapted for other applications and domains because of its modular, multi-layer architecture.},\n  langid = {english}\n}\n\n@article{10.14529/jsfi180103,\n  title = {Survey of {{Storage Systems}} for {{High-Performance Computing}}},\n  author = {L{\\"u}ttgau, Jakob and Kuhn, Michael and Duwe, Kira and Alforov, Yevhen and Betke, Eugen and Kunkel, Julian and Ludwig, Thomas},\n  year = {2018},\n  month = apr,\n  journal = {Supercomputing Frontiers and Innovations},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {31--58},\n  issn = {2313-8734},\n  doi = {10.14529/jsfi180103},\n  url = {https://superfri.org/index.php/superfri/article/view/162},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {In current supercomputers, storage is typically provided by parallel distributed file systems for hot data and tape archives for cold data. These file systems are often compatible with local file systems due to their use of the POSIX interface and semantics, which eases development and debugging because applications can easily run both on workstations and supercomputers. There is a wide variety of file systems to choose from, each tuned for different use cases and implementing different optimizations. However, the overall application performance is often held back by I/O bottlenecks due to insufficient performance of file systems or I/O libraries for highly parallel workloads. Performance problems are dealt with using novel storage hardware technologies as well as alternative I/O semantics and interfaces. These approaches have to be integrated into the storage stack seamlessly to make them convenient to use. Upcoming storage systems abandon the traditional POSIX interface and semantics in favor of alternative concepts such as object and key-value storage; moreover, they heavily rely on technologies such as NVM and burst buffers to improve performance. Additional tiers of storage hardware will increase the importance of hierarchical storage management. Many of these changes will be disruptive and require application developers to rethink their approaches to data management and I/O. A thorough understanding of today\'s storage infrastructures, including their strengths and weaknesses, is crucially important for designing and implementing scalable storage systems suitable for demands of exascale computing.},\n  copyright = {Copyright (c)},\n  langid = {english}\n}\n\n@article{10.14529/jsfi200101,\n  title = {State of the {{Art}} and {{Future Trends}} in {{Data Reduction}} for {{High-Performance Computing}}},\n  author = {Duwe, Kira and L{\\"u}ttgau, Jakob and Mania, Georgiana and Squar, Jannek and Fuchs, Anna and Kuhn, Michael and Betke, Eugen and Ludwig, Thomas},\n  year = {2020},\n  month = apr,\n  journal = {Supercomputing Frontiers and Innovations},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {4--36},\n  issn = {2313-8734},\n  doi = {10.14529/jsfi200101},\n  url = {https://superfri.org/index.php/superfri/article/view/303},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {Research into data reduction techniques has gained popularity in recent years as storage capacity and performance become a growing concern.

In this paper, we explore how the challenge is not merely a factor of availability and affordability of computing, network, and storage technologies but rather the result of insufficient interfaces with an increasingly heterogeneous mix of computing technologies and data sources. With more distributed computation and data, scientists, educators, and students must invest their time and effort in coordinating data access and movements, often penalizing their scientific research. Investments in the interfaces' software stack are necessary to help scientists, educators, and students across domains take advantage of advanced computational methods.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Query Language in identifying performance bottlenecks and enhancing Hatchet's analysis capabilities through three case studies.

Our service indexes scientific data at a fine-granularity at the file or object level to inform data distribution strategies and to improve the experience for users from the consumer perspective, with the goal of allowing end-to-end dataflow optimizations.}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{10.1145/3588195.3592989,\n  title = {Thicket: {{Seeing}} the Performance Experiment Forest for the Individual Run Trees},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 32nd International {{ACM}} Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing ({{HPDC}})},\n  author = {Brink, Stephanie and McKinsey, Michael and Boehme, David and Hawkins, W.

This pattern introduces high I/O overheads and results in increased storage space utilization especially for workflows that need to capture the evolution of data structures with high frequency as checkpoints. In this context, many applications, such as graph pattern matching, perform sparse updates to large data structures between checkpoints. For these applications, incremental checkpointing techniques that save only the differences from one checkpoint to another can dramatically reduce the checkpoint sizes, I/O bottlenecks, and storage space utilization. However, such techniques are not without challenges: it is non-trivial to transparently determine what data has changed since a previous checkpoint and assemble the differences in a compact fashion that does not result in excessive metadata. State-of-art data reduction techniques (e.g., compression and de-duplication) have significant limitations when applied to modern HPC applications that leverage GPUs: slow at detecting the differences, generate a large amount of metadata to keep track of the differences, and ignore crucial spatiotemporal checkpoint data redundancy. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a Merkle tree-based incremental checkpointing method to exploit GPUs' high memory bandwidth and massive parallelism. Experimental results at scale show a significant reduction of the I/O overhead and space utilization of checkpointing compared with state-of-the-art incremental checkpointing and compression techniques.},\n  isbn = {979-8-4007-0843-5},\n  keywords = {Checkpointing,data versioning,de-duplication,GPU parallelization,incremental storage}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{zanonboitoDeepLookTemporal2025,\n  title = {A {{Deep Look Into}} the {{Temporal I}}/{{O Behavior}} of {{HPC Applications}}},\n  booktitle = {2025 {{IEEE International Parallel}} and {{Distributed Processing Symposium}} ({{IPDPS}})},\n  author = {Zanon Boito, Francieli and Teylo, Luan and Popov, Mihail and Jolivel, Th{\\'e}o and Tessier, Fran{\\c c}ois and Luettgau, Jakob and Monniot, Julien and Tarraf, Ahmad and Carneiro, Andr{\\'e} and Osthoff, Carla},\n  year = {2025},\n  url = {https://inria.hal.science/hal-04887809},\n  urldate = {2025-02-03},\n  abstract = {The increasing gap between compute and I/O speeds in high-performance computing (HPC) systems imposes the need for techniques to improve applications' I/O performance.

In expectation of exascale systems and in situ analysis also burst buffers will require integration with the archive. Exploring new strategies and developing open software for tape systems is a hurdle due to the lack of affordable storage silos and availability outside of large organizations and due to increased wariness requirements when dealing with ultra-durable data. Lessening these problems by providing virtual storage silos should enable community-driven innovation and enable site operators to add features where they see fit while being able to verify strategies before deploying on production systems.

In particular, high-throughput and ensemble workflows are becoming increasingly common. These workflows impose significant burden on current HPC scheduling systems which typically use slow, centralized schedulers. Generalized hierarchical scheduling (GHS) is a potential solution to face modern workflows but is not widely adopted in HPC yet. One difficulty hindering widespread adoption is the lack of performance models to configure and fit application requirements. The few existing models are often built on stick assumptions that can substantially reduce the analysis realism. In this paper, we reproduce the analysis and improve the realism of a state-of-the-art model presented in ``An Analytical Performance Model of Generalized Hierarchical Scheduling'' [1] by Herbein and co-authors. Specifically, we first reproduce four key analysis studies in the original paper and then expand the model by removing key assumptions, one at a time.

Therewith, the application's behavior can be evaluated without potentially proprietary or confidential software and input data.Even more interesting is the potential of Feign as a virtual laboratory for I/O research: by manipulating trace data, experiments can be conducted; for example, it becomes possible to evaluate the benefit of optimization strategies. Since a plug-in could determine \"future\" activities, this enables us to develop optimal strategies as baselines for any run-time heuristics, but also eases testing of a developed strategy on many applications without modifying them.The paper proposes and evaluates a workflow to automatically apply optimization candidates to application traces and approximate potential performance gains.

There are several different compression algorithms available, with each one also having a unique set of options. These options have a direct influence on the achieved performance and compression results. Furthermore, the algorithms and options to use for a given dataset are highly dependent on the characteristics of said dataset. This paper explores how machine learning can help with identifying fitting compression algorithms with corresponding options based on actual data structure encountered during I/O. In order to do so, a data collection and training pipeline is introduced. Inferencing is performed during regular application runs and shows promising results. Moreover, it provides valuable insights into the benefits of using certain compression algorithms and options for specific data.

The report begins with a description of how climate and weather applications make use of HPC systems, the arising challenges and data requirements, and some trends that are likely to impact future data centre designs. Related work follows that introduces some cost developments, cost modelling and technological developments. The body of the work is an integrated graph-based approach to modelling costs, resilience and performance for storage systems. Storage models are evaluated in several scenarios each introducing some architectural changes to currently deployed high-performance systems and discusses the cost and performance implications. These discussions are made on a high-level of abstraction as no model is able to predict the non-linear behaviour when scaling out big systems accurately. Conclusions identify the potential benefits that more refined models might offer and outline future work. ~ About this document Work package in charge: WP4 Exploitability Actual delivery date for this deliverable: 24 February 2017 Dissemination level: PU (for public use) Lead author:~ Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ), ~Jakob Luettgau Other contributing authors: Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ),~ Julian Kunkel, Jakob Luettgau Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Jens Jensen The University of Reading (UREAD), and Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Bryan Lawrence},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {business models,climate data centre,data centre design,HPC,performance implications.,storage and data movement,storage infrastructure}\n}\n\n@techreport{10.5281/zenodo.1453895,\n  title = {Operational {{Demonstrator}} of {{ESD Middleware}} ({{MS5}})},\n  author = {Kunkel, Julian and Luettgau, Jakob and Betke, Eugen},\n  year = {2017},\n  month = aug,\n  institution = {{Centre of Excellence for Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE)}},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1453895},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1453895},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {The demonstrator consists of three parts: 1) A typical I/O workload that is mimicking checkpoint/restart, 2) a HDF5 VOL Plugin to redirect and persist data to different storage targets and 3) a policy engine that fetches runtime information and adapts the storage target accordingly.},\n  langid = {english}\n}\n\n@techreport{10.5281/zenodo.1453902,\n  title = {Prototypes of {{Alternative Storage Backends}} ({{MS7}})},\n  author = {Kunkel, Julian and Luettgau, Jakob},\n  year = {2018},\n  month = may,\n  institution = {{Centre of Excellence for Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE)}},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1453902},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1453902},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {The objectives of the Exploitability work package within ESiWACE include two objectives: (1) The development of a new way of laying data onto storage which provides performance without compromising the familiar NetCDF interface.

Existing storage environments face usability and performance challenges for both domain scientists and the data centers supporting the scientists. These challenges arise from data discovery/access patterns, and the need to support complex legacy interfaces. In the ESiWACE project, we develop a novel I/O middleware targeting, but not limited to, earth system data. This deliverable sheds light upon the technical design of the ESD middleware, and the user perspective and implications when using the middleware. Its architecture builds on well-established end-user interfaces but utilizes scientific metadata to harness a data structure centric perspective. In contrast to existing solutions, the middleware maps data structures to available storage technology based on several parameters: 1) A data center specific configuration of available hardware with their characteristics; 2) The intended usage pattern explicitly provided by the user and implicitly by the structure of the data. This allows to exploit performance characteristics of a heterogeneous storage environment more efficiently. This deliverable provides the background on data representations and description formats commonly used in earth system modeling. The document isolates the key requirements for an earth system middleware and collects numerous use-case outlining the benefit to existing and anticipated workflows and technologies. Finally, a detailed initial design for the architecture of the earth system middleware is proposed and documented. The document is not intended to describe all components completely but provides a high-level overview that is necessary to build a first prototype as it is planned in the next phase of the ESiWACE project. During this development, the design will be adjusted to match the prototype; the final version of the design document will be delivered with the end of the project. ~ About this document Work package in charge: WP4 Exploitability Actual delivery date for this deliverable: July 2017 Dissemination level: PU Lead author:~ Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum GmbH (DKRZ), Jakob L{\\\"u}ttgau Other contributing authors: Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum GmbH (DKRZ), Julian Kunkel Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Bryan Lawrence, Jens Jensen The University of Reading (UREAD), Bryan Lawrence Seagate Systems UK Limited (SEAGATE), Giuseppe Congiu, Huang Hua Fondazione Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC): Paola Nassisi},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Earth simulation,earth system data,HPC,I/O middleware,storage environments}\n}\n\n@techreport{10.5281/zenodo.3551787,\n  title = {New {{Storage Layout}} for {{Earth System Data}} ({{D4}}.2) ({{Version}} 2.0)},\n  author = {Luettgau, Jakob and Kunkel, Julian and Lawrence, Bryan and Jensen, Jens and Congiu, Giuseppe and Hua, Huan and Paola, Nassisi},\n  year = {2019},\n  month = nov,\n  institution = {{Centre of Excellence for Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE)}},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3551787},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/3551787},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {Making the best use of HPC in Earth simulation requires storing and manipulating vast quantities of data.

In particular long term storage systems employed by scientific users are mainly reliant on tape storage, as they are still the most cost-efficient option even 40 years after their invention in the mid-seventies. Current archival systems are often loosely integrated into the remaining HPC storage infrastructure. However, data analysis tasks require the integration into the scratch storage systems. With the rise of exascale systems and in situ analysis also burst buffers are likely to require integration with the archive. Unfortunately, exploring new strategies and developing open software for tape archive systems is a hurdle due to the lack of affordable storage silos, the resulting lack of availability outside of large organizations and due to increased wariness requirements when dealing with ultra durable data. Eliminating some of these problems by providing virtual storage silos should enable community-driven innovation, and enable site operators to add features where they see fit while being able to verify strategies before deploying on test or production systems. The thesis asseses moderns tape systems and also puts their development over time into perspective. Subsequently, different models for the individual components in tape systems are developed. The models are then implemented in a prototype simulation using discrete event simulation. It is shown that the simulation can be used to approximate the behavior of tape systems deployed in the real world and to conduct experiments without requiring a physical tape system.},\n  advisors = {Julian Kunkel},\n  howpublished = {Online https://wr.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/\\_media/research:theses:jakob\\_luettgau\\_modeling\\_and\\_simulation\\_of\\_tape\\_libraries\\_for\\_hierarchical\\_storage\\_management\\_systems.pdf},\n  langid = {english},\n  school = {Universit{\\"a}t Hamburg}\n}\n'}}]);
