            "content_html": "This post covers a workshop paper about PyDarshan presented at SC23 in the PROTOOLS workshop. Modern scientific applications utilize numerous software and hardware layers to efficiently access data. This approach poses a challenge for I/O optimization because of the need to instrument and correlate information across those layers. The Darshan characterization tool seeks to address this challenge by providing efficient, transparent, and compact runtime instrumentation of many common I/O interfaces. It also includes command-line tools to generate actionable insights and summary reports. However, the extreme diversity of today's scientific applications means  that not all applications are well served by one-size-fits-all analysis tools. In this work we present PyDarshan, a Python-based library that enables agile analysis of I/O performance data. PyDarshan caters to both novice and advanced users by offering ready-to-use HTML reports as well as a rich collection of APIs to facilitate custom analyses.  We present the design of PyDarshan and demonstrate its effectiveness in four diverse real-world analysis use cases.",

NSDF is designed to make sharing data across geographically distributed sites easier for users who lack technical expertise and infrastructure. By developing an easy-to-install software stack, we promote the FAIR data-sharing principles in NSDF while leveraging existing high-speed data transfer infrastructures such as Globus and XRootD. This work shows how we leverage latency and throughput information between geo-distributed NSDF sites with NSDF entry points to optimize the automatic coordination of data placement and transfer across the data fabric, which can further improve the efficiency of data sharing.",

Not all if this data might be worthy to be preserved, but the combination of more, cheaper, faster, higher-resolution sensors, and more capable computational devices lead to ever increasing data generation capabilities. This is true for individuals, business and of course also scientific use cases. Especially, observational data from environmental sensors, satellites, telescopse and other large scale science instruments are producers of large amounts of data which we would like to preserve in long-term archives. Today most long-term are using automated tape libraies as they offer high-capacities at low operating costs. In this article we introduce a data set destilled from 13 years of published data volumes and file counts for various long-term archives mostly used in scientific contexts.",

In most of todays supercomputers, the networks are shared resource which can lead to unpredictable runtime performance due to contention with other applications. The observed network performance in many cases is intimitely related to the underlying network topology. In many HPC systems, this topology is a fat tree which can lead to very characteristic latency patterns especially for large applications that span many nodes.",
