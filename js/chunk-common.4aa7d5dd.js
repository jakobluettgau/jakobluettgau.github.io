Within the Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE) models to better understand cost and performance of current and future systems are being explored.

Long-term archives employed by scientific users are mainly reliant on tape storage, as it remains the most cost-efficient option. Archival systems are often loosely integrated into the HPC storage infrastructure. In expectation of exascale systems and in situ analysis also burst buffers will require integration with the archive. Exploring new strategies and developing open software for tape systems is a hurdle due to the lack of affordable storage silos and availability outside of large organizations and due to increased wariness requirements when dealing with ultra-durable data. Lessening these problems by providing virtual storage silos should enable community-driven innovation and enable site operators to add features where they see fit while being able to verify strategies before deploying on production systems. Different models for the individual components in tape systems are developed. The models are then implemented in a prototype simulation using discrete event simulation. The work shows that the simulations can be used to approximate the behavior of tape systems deployed in the real world and to conduct experiments without requiring a physical tape system.},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-67630-2},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Hierarchical storage systems,Long-term archive,Modeling,Performance,Simulation,Tape,Total cost of ownership}\n}\n\n@techreport{10.5281/zenodo.1228749,\n  title = {Business {{Model}} with {{Alternative Scenarios}} ({{D4}}.1)},\n  author = {Luettgau, Jakob and Kunkel, Julian and Jensen, Jens and Lawrence, Bryan},\n  year = {2017},\n  month = feb,\n  institution = {{Centre of Excellence for Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE)}},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1228749},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1228749},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {Abstract This report summarizes the work on requirements and business models for the storage infrastructure within weather and climate data centres (although much of the work has wider applicability).~ The report concentrates on identifying and evaluating the interplay of important cost factors, along with an introduction to relevant (storage and data movement) hardware and software technology,~ terminology and performance metrics. The report begins with a description of how climate and weather applications make use of HPC systems, the arising challenges and data requirements, and some trends that are likely to impact future data centre designs. Related work follows that introduces some cost developments, cost modelling and technological developments. The body of the work is an integrated graph-based approach to modelling costs, resilience and performance for storage systems. Storage models are evaluated in several scenarios each introducing some architectural changes to currently deployed high-performance systems and discusses the cost and performance implications. These discussions are made on a high-level of abstraction as no model is able to predict the non-linear behaviour when scaling out big systems accurately. Conclusions identify the potential benefits that more refined models might offer and outline future work. ~ About this document Work package in charge: WP4 Exploitability Actual delivery date for this deliverable: 24 February 2017 Dissemination level: PU (for public use) Lead author:~ Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ), ~Jakob Luettgau Other contributing authors: Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ),~ Julian Kunkel, Jakob Luettgau Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Jens Jensen The University of Reading (UREAD), and Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Bryan Lawrence},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {business models,climate data centre,data centre design,HPC,performance implications.,storage and data movement,storage infrastructure}\n}\n\n@techreport{10.5281/zenodo.1453895,\n  title = {Operational {{Demonstrator}} of {{ESD Middleware}} ({{MS5}})},\n  author = {Kunkel, Julian and Luettgau, Jakob and Betke, Eugen},\n  year = {2017},\n  month = aug,\n  institution = {{Centre of Excellence for Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE)}},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1453895},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1453895},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {The demonstrator consists of three parts: 1) A typical I/O workload that is mimicking checkpoint/restart, 2) a HDF5 VOL Plugin to redirect and persist data to different storage targets and 3) a policy engine that fetches runtime information and adapts the storage target accordingly.},\n  langid = {english}\n}\n\n@techreport{10.5281/zenodo.1453902,\n  title = {Prototypes of {{Alternative Storage Backends}} ({{MS7}})},\n  author = {Kunkel, Julian and Luettgau, Jakob},\n  year = {2018},\n  month = may,\n  institution = {{Centre of Excellence for Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE)}},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1453902},\n  url = {https://zenodo.org/record/1453902},\n  urldate = {2022-07-30},\n  abstract = {The objectives of the Exploitability work package within ESiWACE include two objectives: (1) The development of a new way of laying data onto storage which provides performance without compromising the familiar NetCDF interface.

To address this shortcoming, we augment Hatchet with a Call Path Query Language that leverages relational data in the performance analysis of scientific applications. Specifically, our Query Language enables data reduction using call path pattern matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Query Language in identifying performance bottlenecks and enhancing Hatchet's analysis capabilities through three case studies.

In this paper, we explore how the challenge is not merely a factor of availability and affordability of computing, network, and storage technologies but rather the result of insufficient interfaces with an increasingly heterogeneous mix of computing technologies and data sources. With more distributed computation and data, scientists, educators, and students must invest their time and effort in coordinating data access and movements, often penalizing their scientific research.

Our service indexes scientific data at a fine-granularity at the file or object level to inform data distribution strategies and to improve the experience for users from the consumer perspective, with the goal of allowing end-to-end dataflow optimizations.}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{10.1145/3502181.3533709,\n  ids = {olayaNSDFFUSETestbedStudying2022},\n  title = {{{NSDF-FUSE}}: {{A Testbed}} for {{Studying Object Storage}} via {{FUSE File Systems}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{NSDF-FUSE}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 31st {{International Symposium}} on {{High-Performance Parallel}} and {{Distributed Computing}}},\n  author = {Olaya, Paula and Luettgau, Jakob and Zhou, Naweiluo and Lofstead, Jay and Scorzelli, Giorgio and Pascucci, Valerio and Taufer, Michela},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = jun,\n  series = {{{HPDC}} '22},\n  pages = {277--278},\n  publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\n  address = {New York, NY, USA},\n  doi = {10.1145/3502181.3533709},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3502181.3533709},\n  urldate = {2022-07-11},\n  abstract = {This work presents NSDF-FUSE, a testbed for evaluating settings and performance of FUSE-based file systems on top of S3-compatible object storage; the testbed is part of a suite of services from the National Science Data Fabric (NSDF) project (an NSF-funded project that is delivering cyberinfrastructures for data scientists). We demonstrate how NSDF-FUSE can be deployed to evaluate eight different mapping packages that mount S3-compatible object storage to a file system, as well as six data patterns representing different I/O operations on two cloud platforms. NSDF-FUSE is open-source and can be easily extended to run with other software mapping packages and different cloud platforms.},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-9199-3},\n  keywords = {cloud,file system,fuse,object storage,performance}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{10.1145/3502181.3533710,\n  ids = {luettgauNSDFCloudEnablingAdHoc2022a,luettgauNSDFCloudEnablingAdHoc2022b,luettgauNSDFCloudEnablingAdHoc2022c},\n  title = {{{NSDF-Cloud}}: {{Enabling Ad-Hoc Compute Clusters Across Academic}} and {{Commercial Clouds}}},\n  shorttitle = {{{NSDF-Cloud}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 31st {{International Symposium}} on {{High-Performance Parallel}} and {{Distributed Computing}}},\n  author = {Luettgau, Jakob and Olaya, Paula and Zhou, Naweiluo and Scorzelli, Giorgio and Pascucci, Valerio and Taufer, Michela},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = jun,\n  pages = {279--280},\n  publisher = {ACM},\n  address = {Minneapolis MN USA},\n  doi = {10.1145/3502181.3533710},\n  url = {https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3502181.3533710},\n  urldate = {2023-02-15},\n  isbn = {978-1-4503-9199-3},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {cyberinfrastructure,data fabric,virtual machine}\n}\n\n@article{10.1177/10943420231167800,\n  ids = {zhouOrchestrationMaterialsScience2023a},\n  title = {Orchestration of Materials Science Workflows for Heterogeneous Resources at Large Scale},\n  author = {Zhou, Naweiluo and Scorzelli, Giorgio and Luettgau, Jakob and Kancharla, Rahul R and Kane, Joshua J and Wheeler, Robert and Croom, Brendan P and Newell, Pania and Pascucci, Valerio and Taufer, Michela},\n  year = {2023},\n  month = jul,\n  journal = {The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications},\n  volume = {37},\n  number = {3-4},\n  pages = {260--271},\n  publisher = {SAGE Publications Ltd STM},\n  issn = {1094-3420},\n  doi = {10.1177/10943420231167800},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1177/10943420231167800},\n  urldate = {2024-01-22},\n  abstract = {In the era of big data, materials science workflows need to handle large-scale data distribution, storage, and computation. Any of these areas can become a performance bottleneck. We present a framework for analyzing internal material structures (e.g., cracks) to mitigate these bottlenecks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for a workflow performing synchrotron X-ray computed tomography reconstruction and segmentation of a silica-based structure. Our framework provides a cloud-based, cutting-edge solution to challenges such as growing intermediate and output data and heavy resource demands during image reconstruction and segmentation. Specifically, our framework efficiently manages data storage, scaling up compute resources on the cloud. The multi-layer software structure of our framework includes three layers. A top layer uses Jupyter notebooks and serves as the user interface. A middle layer uses Ansible for resource deployment and managing the execution environment. A low layer is dedicated to resource management and provides resource management and job scheduling on heterogeneous nodes (i.e., GPU and CPU). At the core of this layer, Kubernetes supports resource management, and Dask enables large-scale job scheduling for heterogeneous resources. The broader impact of our work is four-fold: through our framework, we hide the complexity of the cloud's software stack to the user who otherwise is required to have expertise in cloud technologies; we manage job scheduling efficiently and in a scalable manner; we enable resource elasticity and workflow orchestration at a large scale; and we facilitate moving the study of nonporous structures, which has wide applications in engineering and scientific fields, to the cloud. While we demonstrate the capability of our framework for a specific materials science application, it can be adapted for other applications and domains because of its modular, multi-layer architecture.},\n  langid = {english}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{zhou_escience22,\n  title = {A Software Framework for Scientific Workflow Orchestration at Large Scale},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th {{IEEE}} International Conference on E-{{Science}} ({{eScience}})},\n  author = {Zhou, Nauweiluo and Luettgau, Jakob and Kancharla, Rahul Reddy and Kane, Joshua and Croom, Brendan and Wheeler, Robert and Newell, Pania and Scorzelli, Giorgio and Pascucci, Valerio and Taufer, Michela},\n  year = {2022},\n  month = oct,\n  pages = {1--1},\n  publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},\n  address = {Salt Lake City, Utah, USA}\n}\n"},92819:(e,n,t)=>{"use strict";t.d(n,{Z:()=>a});const a="@inproceedings{10.1145/3624062.3624207,\n  title = {Enabling {{Agile Analysis}} of {{I}}/{{O Performance Data}} with {{PyDarshan}}},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the {{SC}} '23 {{Workshops}} of {{The International Conference}} on {{High Performance Computing}}, {{Network}}, {{Storage}}, and {{Analysis}}},\n  author = {Luettgau, Jakob and Snyder, Shane and Reddy, Tyler and Awtrey, Nikolaus and Harms, Kevin and Bez, Jean Luca and Wang, Rui and Latham, Rob and Carns, Philip},\n  year = {2023},\n  month = nov,\n  series = {{{SC-W}} '23},\n  pages = {1380--1391},\n  publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\n  address = {New York, NY, USA},\n  doi = {10.1145/3624062.3624207},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3624062.3624207},\n  urldate = {2023-12-02},\n  abstract = {Modern scientific applications utilize numerous software and hardware layers to efficiently access data. This approach poses a challenge for I/O optimization because of the need to instrument and correlate information across those layers. The Darshan characterization tool seeks to address this challenge by providing efficient, transparent, and compact runtime instrumentation of many common I/O interfaces. It also includes command-line tools to generate actionable insights and summary reports. However, the extreme diversity of today's scientific applications means that not all applications are well served by one-size-fits-all analysis tools. In this work we present PyDarshan, a Python-based library that enables agile analysis of I/O performance data. PyDarshan caters to both novice and advanced users by offering ready-to-use HTML reports as well as a rich collection of APIs to facilitate custom analyses. We present the design of PyDarshan and demonstrate its effectiveness in four diverse real-world analysis use cases.},\n  isbn = {979-8-4007-0785-8},\n  keywords = {High-Performance Computing,Input/Output,Performance Analysis,Storage}\n}\n"},79728:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/LLNL-long.988354ca.svg"},29748:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/darshan.42e56f3e.png"},96444:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/ethics-in-hpc.73370254.png"},56157:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/flux.0eb5b79e.png"},75520:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/hatchet.aaa603e6.png"},31545:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/iobat.5edaede1.svg"},92405:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/kubernetes.533af190.png"},14847:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/nsdf.dda46e1f.png"},325:(e,n,t)=>{e.exports=t.p+"img/thicket-logo.2e681a27.png"}}]);
