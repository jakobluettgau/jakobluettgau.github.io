NSDF is designed to make sharing data across geographically distributed sites easier for users who lack technical expertise and infrastructure. By developing an easy-to-install software stack, we promote the FAIR data-sharing principles in NSDF while leveraging existing high-speed data transfer infrastructures such as Globus and XRootD. This work shows how we leverage latency and throughput information between geo-distributed NSDF sites with NSDF entry points to optimize the automatic coordination of data placement and transfer across the data fabric, which can further improve the efficiency of data sharing.","image":"NSDF-Plugin_poster.pptx.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Understanding-Latency-and-Throughput-Constraints-for-NSDF","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Understanding-Latency-and-Throughput-Constraints-for-NSDF","date":"2023-06-20T19:47:39.000Z"},{"title":"The Journey of Making a Hand-Fan","authors":["Jakob Luettgau","Silvina Caino-Lores"],"datetime":"2023-06-17T12:41:00.000Z","text":"This article documents the making of a wodden hand-fan starting from a blank of walnut given to me by a friend. The design borrows from a hand-fan my girlfriend likes very much. We start from cutting slices on the tablesaw, work out down to 0.8mm with the hand plane and cut the rough shape on the laser. Everything gets sanded to final shape before a laser-cut textile screen is added to hold the shape.","image":"./thumb.png","caption":"","published":true,"id":"Crafting-a-Hand-Fan","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Crafting-a-Hand-Fan","date":"2023-06-17T12:41:00.000Z"},{"title":"On the Development of Data Volumes in Long-Term Archives over the last 13 Years","authors":["Jakob Luettgau"],"datetime":"2023-05-30T12:41:00.000Z","text":"New data is being produced at unprecedented scales. Not all if this data might be worthy to be preserved, but the combination of more, cheaper, faster, higher-resolution sensors, and more capable computational devices lead to ever increasing data generation capabilities. This is true for individuals, business and of course also scientific use cases. Especially, observational data from environmental sensors, satellites, telescopse and other large scale science instruments are producers of large amounts of data which we would like to preserve in long-term archives. Today most long-term are using automated tape libraies as they offer high-capacities at low operating costs. In this article we introduce a data set destilled from 13 years of published data volumes and file counts for various long-term archives mostly used in scientific contexts.","image":"./thumb.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"13-Years-of-Long-Term-Archives","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/13-Years-of-Long-Term-Archives","date":"2023-05-30T12:41:00.000Z"}]}
