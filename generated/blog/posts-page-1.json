Modern scientific applications utilize numerous software and hardware layers to efficiently access data. This approach poses a challenge for I/O optimization because of the need to instrument and correlate information across those layers. The Darshan characterization tool seeks to address this challenge by providing efficient, transparent, and compact runtime instrumentation of many common I/O interfaces. It also includes command-line tools to generate actionable insights and summary reports. However, the extreme diversity of today's scientific applications means  that not all applications are well served by one-size-fits-all analysis tools. In this work we present PyDarshan, a Python-based library that enables agile analysis of I/O performance data. PyDarshan caters to both novice and advanced users by offering ready-to-use HTML reports as well as a rich collection of APIs to facilitate custom analyses.  We present the design of PyDarshan and demonstrate its effectiveness in four diverse real-world analysis use cases.","image":"thumb.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Enabling-Agile-Analysis-of-I-O-Performance-Data-with-PyDarshan","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Enabling-Agile-Analysis-of-I-O-Performance-Data-with-PyDarshan","date":"2023-10-10T13:27:37.000Z"}]}
