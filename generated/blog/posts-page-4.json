Without any aspiration to be complete, this post maps out a number of very established machine learning methods and relates them to each other. The resulting graph when using a spring-layout yields an interesting perspective that also intuitively appears appropriate.","image":"./svg/ml_nn-approaches-no-text.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Map-of-Machine-Learning-Approaches","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Map-of-Machine-Learning-Approaches","date":"2021-09-21T17:37:58.000Z"},{"title":"Semiconductor Fabrication Plants Around the World","authors":["Jakob Luettgau"],"datetime":"2021-06-15T11:52:40Z","text":"This article visualizes the locations and characteristics of different semiconductor manufacturing plants across the globe. We take three different lenses on this and consider the process node or features size, the production volum and the cost of different fabrication plants. The data is based on the list of semiconductur manufacturing plants on Wikipedia.","image":"./process_node.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Semiconductor-Fabrication-Plants-Around-the-World","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Semiconductor-Fabrication-Plants-Around-the-World","date":"2021-06-15T11:52:40.000Z"},{"title":"A Closer Look at the Top500 over Time","authors":["Jakob Luettgau"],"datetime":"2021-04-26T18:22:40Z","text":"Twice a year a new toplist of supercomputing is released, the so called Top500. For several decades this project has tracked the technology, the peak performance and the sites of supercomputing deployments. This post recreates some of plots most in the field of High-Performance Computing might be familier with: Tracking the development of the Top500 over time. I needed to play with the data to confirm some assumptions I would make but also out of curiosity. Inparticular we look at the peak performance, processor counts, and power across different machines.","image":"./pdf/plot_top500-top-avg-500-rmax-1.png","caption":null,"published":true,"id":"Revisiting-the-Top500-over-Time","url":"https://jakobluettgau.github.io/#/blog/posts/Revisiting-the-Top500-over-Time","date":"2021-04-26T18:22:40.000Z"}]}
